# Latvian name day data (conversion to JSON)

These are Python scripts for converting the official Latvian name day datasets to JSON.

There are two datasets - the traditional name day list and the extended name day list.

The converted files are located in the `src/lv-namedays/data` folder.

The original datasets are available from Latvia's State Language Centre website:

Use the `generate_ics.py` script in order to generate an .ics calendar file containing daily events with names from the traditional name day list.
